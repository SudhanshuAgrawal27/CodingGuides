Python guide: 
			  This guide assumes you've used Python a fair amount before.

			  The use case is if you've been coding in a different language for a while and suddenly need to use Python again, 
			  you can refer to this guide to refresh your knowledge of Python, while mainly focusing on its idiosyncrasies. 

			  It also contains some good notes on classes and inheritance which should clear up the inevitable confusion one faces when trying to do OOP in Python. 

			  There's also a section on Python's ArgumentParser which should be simpler to understand than the huge doc page. 




1. blocks are demarcated by :  
		like this 

	if x > 5: 
		print(x)

	general rule for every spot you'd expect to have a {   } in C++, 
	including functions, loops, classes, etc. 


2. Scopes: 

	a. By default everything is in the global scope.

	b. Loops DO NOT have their own scope. Variables defined in loops 'leak' into the surrounding scope. 

		for i in range(5): 
			x = -1 
			print(i) 
		
		print(x)  # will print -1 

	c. On the other hand, as expected, if you define a variable in a function, it will belong only to that scope. 



3. Indexing 

	a. General rule - include first index, exclude last index.

		[i : j : step_size] 	gives you all elements from [i, j) with step = step_size

		my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 

		my_list[2:4]   #  this is [2, 3]

	b. Empty colon notation 

		my_list[2:]    # all elements starting at 2 till end 

		my_list[::2]   # only alternate elements 


	c. Python allows negative indexing which is really useful when you want to access the last element of a list. 

		my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

		my_list[-1]		# number 4 


		It also allows negative step sizes which can instantly reverse a list 

		my_list[::-1]  # reverse the list 

		NOTE: if you want to use a negative step size, the i, j values need to be reversed too 
				my_list[5:0:-1]  # will work 
				my_list[0:5:-1]  # will not work
		


4.	Logic  

	For some strange reason, every language has a different way of writing true and false. 

	Python : True , False 
	Julia  : true, false 
	C++    : true, false 
	R      : TRUE, FALSE  or T/F  


	also, logical operators are written out 
		if (x > 5 and x < 10) or (x == -1): 
			print(x) 


	'is'    operator 
		checks whether two objects point to the same location of memory 

		it's like   &x == &y rather than x == y 

		x = [1, 2, 3]
		y = [1, 2, 3]

		x == y   		: True 
		x is y 			: False



	'in'	operator 
		bread and butter for loops 
		
		pretty powerful 

		for c in "Hello"
			print(c)

		can check if something is contained in pretty much any iterable 
			strings, lists, tuples, ranges, dictionaries


5.  Inserting variables in strings (really annoying imo)

	my_string = "Hello my name is {},  my age is {} ".format(Sudhanshu, 19)

	you can also add formatting to the {} like other languages 



6. List comprehension <3

	Keep set-builder notation from math in mind 
		even_numbers = [i for i in range(1, 10, 2)]

	it's also faster than a normal for loop

	if you want to make a list of zeros, you need to use this (unless you're using numpy) 
		initial_values = [0 for _ in range(10)] 

	
	you can also add conditions like set builder notation 

	[VALUE for x in ITERATOR if CONDITION]  # put the condition at the end otherwise 
											# you'll get an error about a missing else

	x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
	[ t for t in x if t%2 == 0 ]
	


7. Dictionaries  <3 

	Probably my favourite data structure. 
		O(1) access 
		Also really makes everything clear cuz it gives you labels for your data

	
	a. Creating one directly 

	my_dict = {"apple":1, "banana":2, "orange":3}   # {KEY: VALUE, KEY: VALUE}
	my_dict["banana"]


	b. Dictionary comprehension 
	
	my_cubes = { x : x**3  for x in range(10) } 



	c. Remember that iterating over a dict using 'in' will return the keys only

	for k in my_dict: 
		print(k)  			// apple, banana, orange 


	d. useful commands :   my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values() 


	e. Empty dictionary : 
		my_dict = {}



8.  Sets 

	Really useful if you don't care about order and want to use 'in' on it a lot 
	O(1) 'in' 

	my_set = {1, 2, 3} 

	NOTE: if want to make an empty set, you can't do my_set = {} - this creates an empty dictionary

	You have to use: 
		my_set = set() 

	
9. Classes 

	class Rectangle: 	
		breadth = 5 
		length = 10

	
	# CREATING AN OBJECT 

	obj = Rectangle()     	# note the () even if there are no arguments 
							# just so you don't forget, in C++ you'd do    Target t; 


	# ACCESSING INSTANCE VARIABLES 

	obj.breadth 
	

	# ALL FUNCTIONS MUST TAKE 'self' as the first argument 

	def area(self): 
		return breadth*length 
	
	obj.area() 


	# CONSTRUCTOR 

	def __init__(self, breadth, length) 
		self.breadth = breadth   			# if you're creating an instance variable you NEED to make 
		self.length = length 				# it an attribute of self. Otherwise it's just a local variable

	
	obj = Rectangle(100, 20) 

	Note: you can create instance variables (fields) in two ways 

		  class myclass: 
		  
		  	field1 = 5 				# easy way

			def __init__(self, f2):

				self.field2 = f2     # using a constructor

	You don't need an __init__ function unless you want to pass something in (or cuz of inheritance)


	# INHERITANCE 

	class subclass(superclass):      # NOTE:  THE PARENTHESES AFTER THE FUNCTION NAME ARE MEANT FOR INHERITANCE NOT ARGUMENTS!!!!

		x = 5 

		def myfunc():
			print(x*3) 

		super().myfunc()			# super() is used to refer to the parent class


		# VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT INHERITANCE 

		# When you manually implement the constructor of the derived class, 
		# you need to call the constructor of the super class
		# But it works anyway?!  
		# It might. But it won't always. 
		# If your base class had an implemented __init__(self, x, y, z) method,
		# then you obviously have to call the constructor. 
		# But what if it didn't take in any arguments? 
		#	__init__(self) 
		#		self.x = 5
		#		self.y = 6
		# If you want these instance variables to be a part of your derived class, 
		# you HAVE to call super().__init__() in the constructor of your derived class. 
		# Basically if you are manually defining the constructor of the base class and the derived class, 
		# you better call super().__init__() in the derived class. 


	Notes: 
		- all methods in classes are virtual - can be overriden 

		- all instance variables are PUBLIC  
			- by convention,  _varname   are not considered part of the API and shouldn't really be used directly - could change
		
		- Empty classes 

			class NiceWrapper:
				pass 
			
			NiceWrapper.x = 5 
			NiceWrapper.y = 10


10. Reading and Writing from/to Files 

	file = open("myfile.txt", "r")    # r, w, a   - default = r
									  # returns a file object 

	# Good Practice - use a 'with' block - automatically closes the file 

	with open("myfile.txt", "r) as file: 
		data = file.read()


	# Reading lines 

	file.readline()   # reads a single line 
					  # if an empty string is returned, the end of the file is reached 

	if you want to loop over each line, it's simpler to use :

	for line in file: 
		print(line)


	# Writing 

	file.write("some new text") 

	If you're in 'w' mode, it will overwrite the entire file 

	If you're in 'a' mode, it will append immediately after - doesn't add an extra line for you


11.  Argument Parser 


# Argument Parser - Reading in arguments from the command line

	from argparse import ArgumentParser

	# instantiate
	parser = ArgumentParser()		


	# adding an argument	      
	parser.add_argument("-n",   				# short form
			"nameOfArgument", 			# full name
						nargs='?', 				# number of args
				default = None,			# default value if nothing passed
				help="A description")		# accessed by cmd --help

	# default 
	nice to keep 
		default = None 
	to see whether an arg was passed at all


	# number of values to be accepted per argument
	nargs: 
		nargs = 4		# expects 4 arguments, puts them in a list
		nargs = '?'		# 0 or 1 argument. if no arg, default value. used for opt args
		nargs = "*"		# places all arguments into a list
		nargs = "+"		# like "*", but requires atleast one cmd line arg to have been passed


	# action 
	action = 'store_true'

	The value of the argument will be set to true if the option was passed
	and default if not, or false if no default is set.

	Ex. shuf -r testfile	# -r takes in no args, just an option - a 0 or 1 state.


	# read in the arguments
	args = parser.parse_args()		# at this point in the code, read in the input

	# accessing the arguments 
	args.argname 
	Ex.	args.filename

	# dictionary form of args 
	vars(args)


x.  Miscellaneous useful commands : 

	a. 	#  comment entry - python doesn't have support for multi line comments 

	b. docstrings : 

		def my_func():
			''' my_func : A test function '''
			print(5) 

		help(my_func)

	
	c. type(x)    # type of the object


	d. Random numbers (annoying in every language) 

			import random 
			random.randrange(1, 10)

	e.  len(my_list) 

	f. 	words = my_string.split(" ")  # split by word 

		characters = my_string.split("") # split by character 

	g.  // integer division 
		6//4    # results in 1 


	h. copy() 

		x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
		y = x 
		x[2] = -2 

		x == y  # still true cuz addresses are copied 

		so you gotta use 

		y = x.copy() 

	g. Unpacking  

		def my_func(*args): 		 # pass in how many ever arguments
			print(args[2])  # the second argument passed in 

		def my_func(**kwargs): 		# pass in how many ever arguments by keyword 
			print(kwargs["a1"])  # the argument passed in with NAME a1 

		my_func(a1 = 5, a2 = 3)

	
	h. Lambda functions - Anonymous functions 

		Create a function that you can't call again, only pass to another function
		Really useful in data science when you're doing map stuff

		lambda ARGUMENTS : EXPRESSION 

		lambda x : x**2 

		map(lambda x: 2x+3, [1, 2, 3, 4])   


		You can also use them to generate functions 

		def func_generator(n):
			return lambda x : n*x    		# a function that multiplies by n 

		func_generator(3)(10)   # results in 30
