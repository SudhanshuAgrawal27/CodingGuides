(wire <> assign combo)

wire my_out; 
assign my_out = (sw[0] & sw[1]); 	// assign is dynamic, keeps checking the value of 		
					// sw[0] and sw[1] and assigns the value to wire my_out


assign MuXIn = {o1, o2, o3};

assign SelectInt = sw[4:2];		// 4,3,2   - 3 bit code 

always @(MuxIn, SelectIn)		// means whenever muxin or selectin changes.
	led = MuxIn[SelectIn];

ucf file is required when you want to use something physical and board specific - switches, leds, etc

testbench: 

module my_module_tb;

my_module test_module( .a0(a0), .a1(a1));   // creates instance mapped to some names

reg a0; 
reg a1; 

initial begin
	# 5 a0 <= 1'b1; 		# after 5 ns, set a0 to 1  - happens just once btw 
	# 10 a1 <= 1'b0; 
end 

always #10 clk = ~clk; 			# increment the clock every 10 ns using always

endmodule
