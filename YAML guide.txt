Guide for the YAML format:

- YAML is case sensitive

- YAML DOES NOT allow using tabs

# comment entries use # 

# Writing lists: 


# if you're writing it as a python type list, 
# entries must be separated by comma + space 
men: [John, Paul, George, Ringo]

# if you're writing it the "conventional" way, 
# entries should start indented (by a space)
# followed by a hyphen + space 
# then the entry 
men:
 - John 
 - Paul 
 - George 
 - Ringo 



# booleans : true/false 
# when you read it in using python, it's automatically converted
