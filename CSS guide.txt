CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

Can control the layout of multiple webpages at once
Also control the layout of multiple elements on a single webpage at once.

Called cascading because the style of the parent element applies to the child elements
	if you make the color of the body text = blue, all headings, paragraphs etc will also be blue

For inline CSS - refer to HTML guide 

Internal CSS  - define styling for the webpage only 

	In the <head> tag of the page, 
	create a block
	  <style> 

	  </style>

	which contains the CSS stuff you'd put in a .css file


External CSS - keep the CSS stuff in another .css file 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">  
		# include it in the html file using <link>
		# rel = relationship between html and resource
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
