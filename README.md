.txt guides for various programming languages and tools commonly used in computer science and software development

This repository has been a recent project of mine (as of April 4th, 2021). Every time I learn a new language/tool, I try and document the important features of the language along with commonly used bits of syntax and the differences with other languages that I've used. 

Since this is a recent project, the guides for the tools that I've learnt in the past have lesser content and I will gradually add more content to them as well. 

The purpose of placing everything in .txt files is that I wanted a simple, no-nonsense way of quickly writing down large amounts of syntax across various languages without any additional frills, so that I could reference and modify them easily whenever I needed to.
